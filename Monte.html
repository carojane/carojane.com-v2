		<h2>Have you met Monte?</h2>
		<p>In September, 2009, I was settling in to a new job and a new apartment after a move to Albuquerque. After living in Europe, moving around often, and moving back home for a year, I was more than ready to settle down in my own place. When I was searching for a place to live, my most important item on the wish list a pet friendly apartment. I was more than ready to adopt a dog.</p>

		<h3>Monkey Dog</h3>

		<h3>The Amazing Travelling Dog</h3>

		<h3>Goodbye</h3>

		<p>On Memorial Day weekend, after a week of recovery, Monte relapsed. First, his back legs failed him, so he couldn't stand up for more than a minute at a time. Then, his front legs gave out, so he couldn't do more than lay on the bed and try to breathe. His breaths got shallower and more labored, not even allowing him to relax enough to sleep. He stopped eating - the dog who would eat anything given the opportunity, refused food. The fight was over for Monte. The day after labor day, I took Monte to the vet, where I said goodbye and watched him sigh out his last breath. I do not regret fighting for him to get one last week together, and I do not regret letting him go in the end.</p>
		<p>I miss Monte so much. Each night, when I'm in bed, I shift my feet by habit, feeling for the sleeping dog burrowed under the covers. He's not there. Little moments pop up where I think of him, or wish he were with me to enjoy a walk or a car ride. Monte was my family for five years, and I am so greatful that I had him in my life.</p>
